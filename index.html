  <div id="aboutme">

    <p>Hello! My name is Jessica and I study software development at Coder Academy in Sydney, Australia. My desire to change career followed me all the time after graduating in Biotechnology Engineering in Brazil and I finally decided to change when the opportunity to move to Australia came up and I would have to start all over from scratch anyway.</p>
    <p>I grabbed the chance and after much research and breaking my head on what to study, I decided to attend a JavaScript workshop for begginers by a group of girls in Australia that encourage the inclusion of women in tech world. On that day I hammered my decision and chose to attend a coding bootcamp.</p>
    <p>And now, here I am building my portfolio and starting a fresh career! I can say that it is not easy since there is so much information to assimilate in just a few months. But with each lesson learned or challenges made in class, my motivation grows. I really have fun learning coding, clearly more in some parts than in others, but the best part is still when I feel satisfied and proud of something I've been able to do.</p>
    <p>Spending my time with people that I love, going to beaches and writing are also things that I usually like to do. Especially developing my skills like aspiring writer. I really want to write a book some day, I'm not sure about what but I will. By the way, diving into the coding bootcamp also led me to do something else that I postponed a few times: create a blog. There are no more excuses for not posting and sharing my words to world. Feel free to check the Medium link in my contacts and explore a little bit more about what I have done during my journey :)</p>
